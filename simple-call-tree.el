;;;; Introduction:
;; This library is based on simple-call-tree.el by Alex Schroeder, but you
;; do not need that library to use it (this is a replacement).
;; It displays a buffer containing a call tree for functions in source
;; code files. You can easily & quickly navigate the call tree, displaying
;; the code in another window, and apply query-replace or other commands
;; to individual functions.

;; When the command `simple-call-tree-display-buffer' or `simple-call-tree-current-function'
;; is executed a call tree for the functions in the current buffer will be created,
;; and in the latter case the point in the call tree is placed on the header
;; closest to its position in the original buffer.
;; If called with a prefix arg the user is also prompted for other files to include
;; in the call tree.
;; The call tree is displayed in a buffer called *Simple Call Tree*,
;; which has a dedicated menu in the menu-bar showing various commands
;; and their keybindings. Most of these commands are self explanatory
;; so try them out.

;;;; Navigation:
;; You can navigate the call tree either by moving through consecutive
;; headers (n/p or N/P keys) or by jumping to main branches (j for branch
;; corresponding to function at point, and J to prompt for a function).
;; When you jump to a branch, it is added to `simple-call-tree-jump-ring',
;; and you can navigate your jump history using the </> keys.
;; You can also add the function under point to the jump-ring with the . key.
;; If you use a negative prefix (e.g. C--) before pressing j then the branch
;; jumped to will not be added to the jump-ring.
;; If you have fm.el (available here: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/fm.el)
;; you can press f to toggle follow mode on/off.

;;;; Display
;; Normally child branches correspond to functions/variables called by the parent
;; branch. However, if you invert the tree by pressing i then the child branches
;; will correspond to functions that call the parent branch.
;; You can sort the tree in various different ways, and change the depth of the tree.
;; You can also narrow the tree to the function at point by pressing /

;;;; Exporting:
;; The tree can be exported in its current state with the `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'
;; command, and you can alter the types of links with the `simple-call-tree-org-link-style' option.
;; This may be useful for project management.

;;;; Refactoring
;; You can perform `query-replace' or `query-replace-regexp' on the function at
;; point by pressing % or C-%, or any other arbitrary command by pressing !
;; This may be useful when refactoring.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put simple-call-tree.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'simple-call-tree)
;;
;; You might also want to define a key for creating the call tree,
;; e.g. like this:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c S") 'simple-call-tree-current-function)

;;; Acknowledgements:
;;
;; Alex Schroeder - the creator of the original simple-call-tree.el
;;
;;

;;; TODO
;;
;; Use / key for filtering headers by name (for consistency with other modes such as gnus & dired)
;; and use a different key for narrowing to the current header.
;;
;; Allow adding headers for arbitrary locations

;; If anyone wants to implement the following ideas, please do:
;; More reliable code for building tree (handle duplicate function names properly).
;; Code for managing refactoring commands (to be applied to marked functions).
;; Multiple query replace command for substituting appropriate lisp macros -
;; e.g. replace (setq list (remove x list)) with (callf2 remove x list)
;; Code for finding (and highlighting?) duplicate code and other code smells (difficult).
;; Idea: break each function down into a list of keywords for the language in question,
;; and look for common subsequences (not too short) among functions.

  "Alist of items containing info about how to split the window when viewing code (e.g. in follow mode). 
The item used to determine the split is the first item with a car that is either an integer less 
than or equal to the current depth, or an s-expression that evaluates to non-nil.

The cdr is used to determine the size and orientation of the split, which are then fed into the
`split-window' function. It can be either a list of size & orientation values for fixed splitting,
or a list of 6 parameters for adaptive splitting.
For fixed splitting the size parameter can be interpreted in one of the following ways:

 positive integer - number of columns/rows to use for the *Simple Call Tree* window
 negative integer - number of columns/rows to use for the code window
 float in range (0,1) - proportion of total columns/rows in existing window to use for 
                        the *Simple Call Tree* window after the split
 float in range (-1,0) - proportion of total columns/rows in existing window to use for the 
                         code window after the split

The orientation parameter can be either 'left, 'right, 'above, 'below, and indicates the position 
of the code window relative to the *Simple Call Tree* window after the split.

For adaptive splitting the following 6 parameters need to be specified (or left at default values):
 1st param: value of space in code window relative to space in call-tree window (c2t in formulas below). 
            A larger value means that the split will have a larger code window. Values between 1 & 5 work well.
 2nd param: value of rows relative to columns (v2h in formulas below). A larger value increases the likelihood 
            of a vertical split. Values between 1 & 20 work well.
 3rd param: orientation of code window for horizontal splits (either left or right)
 4th param: orientation of code window for vertical splits (either above or below)
 5th param: minimum number of columns in horizontal split windows. If the split would otherwise result in
            a code window or call-tree window smaller than this value, it will be enlarged. The value
            can be a positive integer, or a proportion of total columns (i.e. a float between 0.0 & 1.0).
 6th param: minimum number of rows in vertical split windows as either a positive integer, or a 
            proportion of total rows (i.e. a float between 0.0 & 1.0).

To calculate the location and orientation of the adaptive split the following formulas are used:

 value of horizontal split: c2t*(width-hsplit) - (maxl-hsplit)^1.5 
 value of vertical split:   v2h*c2t*(height-vsplit) - v2h*(maxh-vsplit)^1.5

where:
  width & height = width & height of *Simple Call Tree* window before the split
 hsplit & vsplit = positions of horizontal & vertical splits (in number of columns/rows)
            maxl = maximum length of lines in *Simple Call Tree* buffer (excluding tags)
            maxh = maximum number of lines under headers in *Simple Call Tree* buffer
             c2t = value of space in code window relative to space in *Simple Call Tree* window
             v2h = value of vertical split rows relative to horizontal split columns

The values of hsplit & vsplit are chosen to maximize the above mentioned formulas. These value are then
adjusted to ensure that they are within the bounds specified by the 5th & 6th parameters, and maxh & maxl 
respectively, and then substituted back into the formulas to obtain values for the horizontal & vertical splits. 
Whichever has the greatest value is the chosen split."
  ;; Note: several different value formulas were tried before arriving at the ones stated above. It is tempting to
  ;; take square roots of the first term (to have a decreasing marginal value of code window size), or a power of
  ;; 2 instead of 1.5 for the second term, but this results in formulas that are harder to maximize or less responsive
  ;; to parameter changes.

  "Alist of major modes, and information to use for identifying objects for the simple call tree.
Each element is a list in the form '(MAJOR-MODE VALID-FONTS INVALID-FONTS START-TEST END-TEST) where:

MAJOR-MODE is the symbol for the major-mode that this items applies to.

VALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts for finding objects for the call tree (functions/variables/etc).
If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-valid-fonts' will be used.

INVALID-FONTS is either nil or a list of fonts that should not be present in the text properties of
any objects to be added to the call tree. If nil then `simple-call-tree-default-invalid-fonts' will be used.
The invalid fonts will also be checked when finding function calls.

START-TEST indicates how to determing the start of the next object. Potential objects are found by checking
the fonts of tokens in the buffer (against VALID-FONTS). If START-TEST is a function then it will be used as
an additional check for potential objects. It will be passed the buffer position of the beginning of the
current token to check, and should return non-nil if it represents a valid object.

NEXT-FUNC is an alternative way of determining the locations of functions.
It is either nil, meaning the function locations will be determined by fonts and maybe START-TEST,
or a function of no args which returns the position of the next function in the buffer or nil if
there are no further functions.

END-FUNC indicates how to find the end of the current object when parsing a buffer for the call tree.
It can be either a function taking no args which moves point to the end of the current function,
or any non-nil value which means to use the `end-of-defun' function, or nil which means that font changes
will be used to determine the end of an object.

START-REGEXP a regular expression to match the beginning of a token, you can probably leave this blank.
By default it is \"\\_<\".

END-REGEXP a regular expression to match the end of a token, by default this is \"\\_>\"."
